Abstract: I argue that AI alignment should be reconceived as architecting syntropic, reasons-responsive agents through process-based, multi-agent, developmental mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human value content. The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation. While the framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions about value emergence and moral agency in artificial systems, empirical validation remains pending.

Abstract: Current AI paradigms, as "architects of experience," face fundamental challenges in explainability and value alignment. This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation. Results indicate that the architecture achieves transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in unprecedented scenarios, establishing a practical and theoretical foundation for building trustworthy and aligned AGI.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models "overthink" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks. When a declarative exemplar is provided, even CodeLlama-13B can outperform GPT-4o in difficult Zebra puzzles.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Active inference proposes expected free energy as an objective for planning and decision-making to adequately balance exploitative and explorative drives in learning agents. The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities for social interaction and are increasingly being deployed in situations where they might engage with both human and artificial agents. These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement.

Abstract: Agentic reasoning models trained with multimodal reinforcement learning (MMRL) have become increasingly capable, yet they are almost universally optimized using sparse, outcome-based rewards computed based on the final answers. Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.

Abstract: Communication is one of the effective means to improve the learning of cooperative policy in multi-agent systems. However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach across several communication-constrained benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce PARC, a coding agent for the autonomous and robust execution of long-horizon computational tasks. PARC is built on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture incorporating task planning, execution, and a mechanism that evaluates its own actions and their outcomes from an independent context and provides feedback, namely self-assessment and self-feedback. This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines. These results highlight the potential of integrating a hierarchical multi-agent system with self-assessment and self-feedback to enable AI systems capable of independent, large-scale scientific and analytical work.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, autonomous agents often struggle to solve complex tasks in enterprise domains that require coordinating multiple tools and processing diverse data sources. This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents. Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.

Abstract: This paper proposes DeepRule, an integrated framework for automated business rule generation in retail assortment and pricing optimization. Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.
  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large-scale language and vision models, AI agents still suffer from a fundamental limitation: they cannot remember. Without reliable memory, agents catastrophically forget past experiences, struggle with long-horizon reasoning, and fail to operate coherently in multimodal or interactive environments. We introduce MemVerse, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play memory framework that bridges fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, enabling scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence. MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemVerse significantly improves multimodal reasoning and continual learning efficiency, empowering agents to remember, adapt, and reason coherently across extended interactions.

Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has gained traction as a promising solution for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.

Abstract: Recent advances in Omni models have enabled unified multimodal perception and generation. However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: The advancement in Large Language Models has driven the creation of complex agentic systems, such as Deep Research Agents (DRAs), to overcome the limitations of static Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in handling complex, multi-turn research tasks. This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.
  The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.
  We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score. The Static-DRA offers a pragmatic and resource-aware solution, empowering users with transparent control over the deep research process.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a logic programming-based framework for policy-aware autonomous agents that can reason about potential penalties for non-compliance and act accordingly. While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

Abstract: Industrial automation increasingly requires flexible control strategies that can adapt to changing tasks and environments. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for such adaptive planning and execution but lack standardized benchmarks for systematic comparison. We introduce a benchmark with an executable simulation environment representing the Blocksworld problem providing five complexity categories. By integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standardized tool interface, diverse agent architectures can be connected to and evaluated against the benchmark without implementation-specific modifications. A single-agent implementation demonstrates the benchmark's applicability, establishing quantitative metrics for comparison of LLM-based planning and execution approaches.
